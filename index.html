            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>My journey at UEM has been a thrilling adventure filled with diverse experiences that have truly shaped my academic and professional growth. ðŸŽ“âœ¨

                Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to dive into various events where I learned from talented developers and participated in financial events. One of my favorite roles was taking the lead in creating posters and flyersâ€”who knew design could be so fun? ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¡ These experiences not only honed my leadership and organizational skills but also sparked my passion for collaboration.
                
                Driven by my interest in web and app development, Iâ€™ve started learning about these fields on my own. Itâ€™s been a challenging yet rewarding journey, and I canâ€™t wait to dive even deeper! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
                
                Whether Iâ€™m working solo or with a team, Iâ€™ve sharpened my time management, creative problem-solving, and communication skills. Iâ€™m excited about the future and look forward to leveraging these experiences in my next professional role.
                
                What about you? Have you had similar experiences that shaped your path? Letâ€™s share our journeys and learn from each other! ðŸŒŸ</p>
